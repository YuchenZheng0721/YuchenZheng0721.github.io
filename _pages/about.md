# Biography

I am a first-year MS in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, working at NLP lab with [Dr. Yu Li](https://yooli23.github.io/). under the supervision of [Professor Zhou Yu]( https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/). Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from Xidian University（2020-2024）. During this period, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences for two months under the guidance of Professor [Yunlong Wang](https://wylcasia.github.io/.).

My research interests lie in natural language processing. I am particularly interested in areas such as vision-language models, multi-modal learning, and their applications in real-world tasks.
